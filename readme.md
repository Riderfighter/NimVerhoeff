# What is the Verhoeff algorithm?

> [As the best source says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verhoeff_algorithm), "The Verhoeff algorithm is a checksum formula for error detection developed by the Dutch mathematician Jacobus Verhoeff".

----

## Usage

> To generate the checksum of a number use: 
```
checksum("12340")
```
> To generate the check digit that would make the number valid use:
```
calc_check_digit("1234")
```
> To check if a number is valid use:
```
is_valid("12340")
```
